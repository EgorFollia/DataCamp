You now know that there's a difference between the job of the data engineer and the data scientist. Remember the definition of a data engineer:

An engineer that develops, constructs, tests, and maintains architectures such as databases and large-scale processing systems.

# DE : develop scalable data architecture, ...
# DS : statistical modelling, ...
