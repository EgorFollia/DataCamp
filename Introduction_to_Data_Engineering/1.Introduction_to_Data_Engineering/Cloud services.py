There are a bunch of cloud services that all have different use cases. It can be hard to keep track of all of them.

Here's an overview of the ones you've seen:

Storage: use the cloud to store unstructured data, like files.
Compute: use virtual machines in the cloud to do complex calculations.
Database: use databases, typically SQL, in the cloud to hold structured data.
In addition, different cloud providers have different names for each of these services...
