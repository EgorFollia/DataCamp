'''
In the video on Databases, you saw the difference between SQL and NoSQL. You saw that SQL uses database schemas to define relations and that NoSQL allows you to work with less structured data.

You might also remember some open-source examples of SQL and NoSQL databases and their use cases.

# SQL : MySQL, PostgreSQL, Customer data, Datanase schema
# noSQL : Shemaless, caching layer in distrubuted web server, MongoDB
