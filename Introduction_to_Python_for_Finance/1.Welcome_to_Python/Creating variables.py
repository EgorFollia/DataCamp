'''
Variables in Python hold a value that may consist of varying data types. Variable names can contain letters, underscores, and numbers.

Let's create three types of Python variables that might be useful in finance.

'''


# Create company_1
company_1 = 'Apple'
print(company_1)

# Create year_1
year_1 = 2017
print(year_1)

# Create revenue_1
revenue_1 = 229.23
print(revenue_1)
