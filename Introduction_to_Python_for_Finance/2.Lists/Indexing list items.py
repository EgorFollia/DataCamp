'''
Each item in a list has an assigned indexed value. Remember that Python is a zero indexed language, and the first element in a list is stored at index zero. In this exercise, you will practice subsetting single elements from a list.

Lists names and prices for company names and stock prices are available in your workspace.

'''


# Print the first item in names
print(names[0])

# Print the second item in names
print(names[1])

# Print the last element in prices
print(prices[-1])
