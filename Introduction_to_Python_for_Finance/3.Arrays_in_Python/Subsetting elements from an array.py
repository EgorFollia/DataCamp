'''
Subsetting arrays is similar to subsetting lists. In this exercise, you will practice just that.

numpy is imported as np and prices_array is available in your workspace.

'''


# Subset the first three elements
prices_subset_1 = prices_array[:3]
print(prices_subset_1)


# Subset last three elements
prices_subset_2 = prices_array[-3:]
print(prices_subset_2)


# Subset every third element
prices_subset_3 = prices_array[0:7:3]
print(prices_subset_3)
