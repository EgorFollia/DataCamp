Whats the main difference between the images shown below?

Image of coffee next to coins image
These images have been preloaded as coffee_image and coins_image from the scikit-image data module using:

coffee_image = data.coffee()
coins_image = data.coins()
Choose the right answer that best describes the main difference related to color and dimensional structure.

In the console, use the function shape() from NumPy, to obtain the image shape (Height, Width, Dimensions) and find out. NumPy is already imported as np.

'''


# coffee_image = data.coffee()
# coins_image = data.coins()

# In [2]: coffee_image.shape, coins_image.shape
# Out[2]: ((400, 600, 3), (303, 384))
