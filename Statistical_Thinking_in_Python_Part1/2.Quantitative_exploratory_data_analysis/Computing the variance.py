It is important to have some understanding of what commonly-used functions are doing under the hood. Though you may already know how to compute variances, this is a beginner course that does not assume so. In this exercise, we will explicitly compute the variance of the petal length of Iris veriscolor using the equations discussed in the videos. We will then use np.var() to compute it.

# Array of differences to mean: differences
differences = np.array(versicolor_petal_length - 
                      np.mean(versicolor_petal_length))

# Square the differences: diff_sq
diff_sq = differences ** 2

# Compute the mean square difference: variance_explicit
variance_explicit = np.mean(diff_sq)

# Compute the variance using NumPy: variance_np
variance_np = np.var(versicolor_petal_length)

# Print the results
print(variance_explicit, variance_np)
