'''
Let's say a bank made 100 mortgage loans. It is possible that anywhere between 0 and 100 of the loans will be defaulted upon. You would like to know the probability of getting a given number of defaults, given that the probability of a default is p = 0.05. To investigate this, you will do a simulation. You will perform 100 Bernoulli trials using the perform_bernoulli_trials() function you wrote in the previous exercise and record how many defaults we get. Here, a success is a default. (Remember that the word "success" just means that the Bernoulli trial evaluates to True, i.e., did the loan recipient default?) You will do this for another 100 Bernoulli trials. And again and again until we have tried it 1000 times. Then, you will plot a histogram describing the probability of the number of defaults.

# Seed random number generator
np.random.seed(42)

# Initialize the number of defaults: n_defaults
n_defaults = np.empty(1000)

# Compute the number of defaults
for i in range(len(n_defaults)):
    n_defaults[i] = perform_bernoulli_trials(100, 0.05)


# Plot the histogram with default number of bins; label your axes
_ = plt.hist(n_defaults, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('number of defaults out of 100 loans')
_ = plt.ylabel('probability')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
