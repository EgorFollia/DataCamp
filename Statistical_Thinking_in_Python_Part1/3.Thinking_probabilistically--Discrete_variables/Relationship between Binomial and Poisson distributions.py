You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to np approximates a Binomial distribution for n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success (with n large and p small). Importantly, the Poisson distribution is often simpler to work with because it has only one parameter instead of two for the Binomial distribution.

Let's explore these two distributions computationally. You will compute the mean and standard deviation of samples from a Poisson distribution with an arrival rate of 10. Then, you will compute the mean and standard deviation of samples from a Binomial distribution with parameters n and p such that np=10.

# Draw 10,000 samples out of Poisson distribution: samples_poisson
samples_poisson = np.random.poisson(10, size = 10000)

# Print the mean and standard deviation
print('Poisson:     ', np.mean(samples_poisson),
                       np.std(samples_poisson))

# Specify values of n and p to consider for Binomial: n, p
n, p = [20, 100, 1000], [.5, .1, .01]

# Draw 10,000 samples for each n,p pair: samples_binomial
for i in range(3):
    samples_binomial = np.random.binomial(n[i], p[i], 10000)

    # Print results
    print('n =', n[i], 'Binom:', np.mean(samples_binomial),
                                 np.std(samples_binomial))
