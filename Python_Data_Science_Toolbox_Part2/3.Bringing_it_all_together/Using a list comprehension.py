'''
This time, you're going to use the lists2dict() function you defined in the last exercise to turn a bunch of lists into a list of dictionaries with the help of a list comprehension.

The lists2dict() function has already been preloaded, together with a couple of lists, feature_names and row_lists. feature_names contains the header names of the World Bank dataset and row_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist is a list of actual values of a row from the dataset.

Your goal is to use a list comprehension to generate a list of dicts, where the keys are the header names and the values are the row entries.

# Print the first two lists in row_lists
print(row_lists[0])
print(row_lists[1])

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Print the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts
print(list_of_dicts[0])
print(list_of_dicts[1])
