'''
In this exercise, you will practice writing a simple lambda function and calling this function. Recall what you know about lambda functions and answer the following questions:

How would you write a lambda function add_bangs that adds three exclamation points '!!!' to the end of a string a?
How would you call add_bangs with the argument 'hello'?
You may use the IPython shell to test your code.

'''


# add_bangs = (lambda a: a + '!!!')
# add_bangs('hello')
