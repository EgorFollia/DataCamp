'''
In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype, strings. Recall that these represent textual data. To assign the string 'DataCamp' to a variable company, you execute:

company = 'DataCamp'
You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings. Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:

object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
object2 = 1 * 3
object3 = "1" * 3
What are the values in object1, object2, and object3, respectively?

'''


In [1]: object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
... 

In [2]: object2 = 1 * 3
... 

In [3]: object3 = "1" * 3
... 

In [4]: object1
Out[4]: 'dataanalysisvisualization'

In [5]: object2
Out[5]: 3

In [6]: object3
Out[6]: '111'
