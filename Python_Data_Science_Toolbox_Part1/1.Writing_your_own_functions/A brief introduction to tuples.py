Alongside learning about functions, you've also learned about tuples! Here, you will practice what you've learned about tuples: how to construct, unpack, and access tuple elements. Recall how Hugo unpacked the tuple even_nums in the video:

a, b, c = even_nums

A three-element tuple named nums has been preloaded for this exercise. Before completing the script, perform the following:

Print out the value of nums in the IPython shell. Note the elements in the tuple.
In the IPython shell, try to change the first element of nums to the value 2 by doing an assignment: nums[0] = 2. What happens?

'''


# Unpack nums into num1, num2, and num3
num1, num2, num3 = nums

# Construct even_nums
even_nums = (2, num2, num3)
