In the video, Hugo briefly examined the return behavior of the built-in functions print() and str(). Here, you will use both functions and examine their return values. A variable x has been preloaded for this exercise. Run the code below in the console. Pay close attention to the results to answer the question that follows.

Assign str(x) to a variable y1: y1 = str(x)
Assign print(x) to a variable y2: y2 = print(x)
Check the types of the variables x, y1, and y2.
What are the types of x, y1, and y2?

In [1]: y1 = str(x)

In [2]: y2 = print(x)

In [3]: print(type(x), type(y1), type(y2))
