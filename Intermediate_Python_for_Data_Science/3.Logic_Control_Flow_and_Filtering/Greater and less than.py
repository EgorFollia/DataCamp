'''
In the video, Filip also talked about the less than and greater than signs, < and > in Python. You can combine them with an equals sign: <= and >=. Pay attention: <= is valid syntax, but =< is not.

All Python expressions in the following code chunk evaluate to True:

3 < 4
3 <= 4
"alpha" <= "beta"
Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.

'''


# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6


# Comparison of strings
y = "test"


# Comparison of booleans
print(x >= -10, "test" <= y, True > False)
