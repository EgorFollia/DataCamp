'''
Filip mentioned that different types behave differently in Python.

When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

In the script some variables with different types have already been created. It's up to you to use them.

savings = 100
growth_multiplier = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of growth_multiplier and savings to year1
year1 = growth_multiplier * savings

# Print the type of year1
print(type( year1 ))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)
